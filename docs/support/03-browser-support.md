## Browser support

Web SDK requires a browser that supports WebGL, a method of generating dynamic 3D graphics using JavaScript, accelerated through hardware (GPU). 

Regarding to the rendering, Web SDK is based on **deck.gl** library, and that implies a good support on a broad base of browsers, including common mobile devices.

The library is tested periodically on the latest browser versions, specially Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
