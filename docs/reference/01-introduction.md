## Introduction

Web SDK is a JavaScript library to create custom location intelligence applications that leverage the power of [CARTO](https://carto.com/). It uses [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/) to enable great vector maps, adding the power of CARTO as a Platform (data management, security, robust APIs...).

To understand the fundamentals of CARTO Web SDK, [read the guides]({{site.web-sdk_docs}}/guides/). To view the source code, browse the [open source repository](https://github.com/CartoDB/web-sdk) in GitHub and contribute. Otherwise, view [examples]({{site.web-sdk_docs}}/examples/) or find different [support options]({site.web-sdk_docs}}/support/).
